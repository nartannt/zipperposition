(*

  - disjointness (simplification):
    * an equation [c1(...) = c2(...)] becomes false;
    * a disequation [c1(...) != c2(...)] becomes true

  - injectivity (simplification):
    * an equation [c(t1...tn) = c(u1...un)] simplifies into
      [t1 = u1 & ... & tn = un]
    * a disequation [c(t1...tn) != c(u1...un)] simplifies into
      [t1 != u1 || ... || tn != un]
      (XXX is it really needed? probably, if we keep literal selection)

  - acyclicity (simplification):
    * an equation [t = c1(...,(...,ck(...,t, ...), ...),...))] where every [c]
      is an inductive constructor becomes [false]
    * an inequation [t != c1(....(...,ck(...,t,...), ...),...)]
      becomes [true]

  - acyclicity (inference):
    same as the simplification but also unifies one side of the equation
     with subterms in cstor-generated contexts

   - exhaustiveness (inference):
      for a maximal ground literal [t != u], where at least one of [t,u] is not
      an inductive constant (i.e. a parameter of the background theory),
      we instantiate the exhaustiveness axiom for [t] and [u], i.e.
      [t = cstor1(…) | … | t = cstor_n(…)] with fresh sub-constants in
      the […].
