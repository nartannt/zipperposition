(** {1 Priority Queue of clauses} *)

(** Heuristic selection of clauses, using a priority queue.
    Only one queue is used, but the priority of a clause is determined by
    a combination of criteria that {b should} include at least one fair
    criterion (e.g. the age of the clause, so that older clauses are more
    likely to be chosen). *)
