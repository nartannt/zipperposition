(** {1 Simple and Lightweight Congruence and order} *)

(** Congruence Closure provides an efficient, lightweight procedure for deciding
    equality on ground terms (i.e. ignoring variables).
    Here we have a simple implementation that is mostly used to
    check if clauses are tautologies w.r.t. equality *)

module type S = Congruence_intf.S

(** {2 Functor} *)

module type TERM = sig
  type t

  val equal : t -> t -> bool
  (** Syntactic equality on terms *)

  val hash : t -> int
  (** Hash function on terms *)

  val subterms : t -> t list
  (** Subterms of the term (possibly empty list) *)

  val update_subterms : t -> t list -> t
  (** Replace immediate subterms by the given list.
      This is used to test for equality *)

  val pp : t CCFormat.printer
end

module Make (T : TERM) : S with type term = T.t

(** {2 Common implementations} *)
