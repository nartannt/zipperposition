(** {1 Reduction to CNF and Simplifications} *)

(** {!CNF} allows to transition from a free-form AST (with statements containing
    formulas as {!TypedSTerm.t}) into an AST using clauses
    and without some constructs such as "if/then/else" or "match" or "let".
    The output is more suitable for a Superposition-like prover.

    There also are conversion functions to go from clauses that use
    {!TypedSTerm.t}, into clauses that use the {!Term.t} (hashconsed,
    and usable in unification, indexing, etc.).

    We follow chapter 6 "Computing small clause normal forms"
    of the "handbook of automated reasoning" for the theoretical part.

    A few notes:

    In worst case, normal CNF transformation can lead to an exponential
    number of clauses, which is prohibitive. To avoid that, we use
    the Tseitin trick to {b name} some intermediate formulas
    by introducing fresh symbols (herein named "proxies") and
    defining them to be equivalent to the formula they define.

    This is done only if we estimate that adding the proxy will
    reduce the final number of clauses (See [Estimation] module).

    Before doing CNF we remove all the high-level constructs
    such as pattern-matching and "let" by introducing
    new symbols and defining the subterm to eliminate using
    this new symbol (See [Flatten] module).
    It is important to capture variables properly in this
    phase (as in closure conversion).

   | LazyCnf
       (** if enabled, inital formulas will not be converted to the
      clausal form. Instead, formulas will be presented as is,
      and lazy calculus rules will be used to clausify. *)
   | DistributeExists
       (** if enabled, will distribute existential quantifiers over
      disjunctions. This can make skolem symbols smaller (smaller arity) but
      introduce more of them. *)
   | DisableRenaming
       (** disables formula renaming. Can re-introduce the worst-case
      exponential behavior of CNF. *)

   | PostNNF of (form -> form)
       (** any processing that keeps negation at leaves,
      just after reduction to NNF. Its output
      must not break the NNF form (negation at root only). *)
   | PostSkolem of (form -> form)
       (** transformation applied just after skolemization. It must not
      break skolemization nor NNF (no quantifier, no non-leaf negation). *)
