(** {1 Perfect Discrimination Tree} *)

(** This module provides a simplification index, based on a
    perfect discrimination tree (see "the handbook of automated reasoning",
    chapter "term indexing", for instance).

    The simplification index can only retrieve {b generalizations}
    of a given query term, but it does it efficiently.

    It is used for demodulation (rewriting) in Superposition.
