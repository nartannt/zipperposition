(** {1 Non-Perfect Discrimination Tree} *)

(** This module provides a simplification index and a term index, based on a
    non-perfect discrimination tree (see "the handbook of automated reasoning",
    chapter "term indexing", for instance). It should be more compact
    in memory than {!Dtree}, and maybe more optimized too.
