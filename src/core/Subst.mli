(** {1 Substitutions} *)

(** Substitutions map (scoped) variables to terms/types.

    They work on free variables (within a scope, so that the same variable can
    live within several scopes).

    The concept of scope is to allow the same free variable to be used in
    several contexts without being renamed. A scope is kind of a namespace,
    where variables from distinct namespaces are always distinct.
*)

type term = InnerTerm.t
type var = InnerTerm.t HVar.t

(** {2 Renamings}
    A renaming is used to disambiguate variables that come from distinct
    scopes but have the same index. It is used to merge together several scopes, in
    a sound way, by ensuring variables from those scopes are mapped to distinct
    variables of the new scope. For instance, a given renaming applied to (X,0) and
    (X,1) will return two different variables, as if one of the X had been renamed
    prior to unification/binding. *)

module Renaming : sig
  type t

  val create : unit -> t
  (** Make a fresh renaming. It can only grow, so it is safe to use
      it as a value. *)

  val none: t

type t
(** A substitution that binds term variables to other terms *)

type subst = t

val empty : t
(** The identity substitution *)

val is_empty : t -> bool
(** Is the substitution empty? *)

val find_exn : t -> var Scoped.t -> term Scoped.t

    in [subst] *)

val get_var : t -> var Scoped.t -> term Scoped.t option
(** Lookup recursively the var in the substitution, until it is not a
    variable anymore, or it is not bound.
    @return None if the variable is not bound, [Some (deref (t, sc_t))]
      if [v] is bound to [t, sc_t] *)

val mem : t -> var Scoped.t -> bool
(** Check whether the variable is bound by the substitution *)

exception InconsistentBinding of var Scoped.t * term Scoped.t * term Scoped.t

val bind : t -> var Scoped.t -> term Scoped.t -> t
(** Add [v] -> [t] to the substitution. Both terms have a context.
    It is {b important} that the bound term is De-Bruijn-closed (assert).
    @raise InconsistentBinding if [v] is already bound in
      the same context, to another term. *)

val update : t -> var Scoped.t -> term Scoped.t -> t
(** Replace [v] -> ? by  [v] -> [t] in the substitution. Both terms have a context.
    It is {b important} that the bound term is De-Bruijn-closed (assert).
    @raise InconsistentBinding if [v] is not yet bound in the same context. *)

val merge : t -> t -> t
(** [merge s1 s2] is the substitution that maps [t] to [(s1 t)] or to [(s2 t)].
    @raise InconsistentBinding if the substitutions disagree. *)

val remove : t -> var Scoped.t -> t
(** Remove the given binding. No other variable should depend on it... *)

val filter_scope : t -> Scoped.scope -> t
(** Only keep bindings from this scope *)

(** {2 Set operations} *)

(** Domain of substitution *)

(** Codomain (image terms) of substitution *)

val introduced : t -> (var Scoped.t) Iter.t
(** Variables introduced by the substitution (ie vars of codomain) *)

val normalize : t -> t
(** Normalize bindings that are in the same scope.
    E.g. [x0 -> f(y0), y0 -> g(z0), z0->a]
    becomes [x0->f(g(a))0, y0->g(a)0, z0->g(z0)] *)

(** {2 Applying a substitution} *)

val apply : ?shift_vars:int -> Renaming.t -> t -> term Scoped.t -> term
(** Apply the substitution to the given term.
    This function assumes that all terms in the substitution are closed,
    and it will not perform De Bruijn indices shifting. For instance,
    applying [{X -> f(db0)}] (with [db0] the De Bruijn index [0])
    to the term [forall. p(X)] will yield [forall. p(f(db0))] (capturing)
    and not [forall. p(f(db1))].
